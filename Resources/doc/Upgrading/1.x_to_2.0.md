Upgrade instructions for upgrading from version 1.x to 2.0
==========================================================

1. Upgrade the Migration Bundle to the 2.0 version using composer

2. before you try to execute any further migration, run the following command

        php ezpublish/console kaliop:migration:migrate --path=vendor/kaliop/ezmigrationbundle/MigrationVersions/20100101000200_MigrateV1ToV2.php

    This will populate the v2 migrations table in the db with information from the v1 database table.
    
    The v1 database table will be left in the database; feel free to drop it when you feel safe enough that you will
    not need to roll back the Migration Bundle to its version 1.
