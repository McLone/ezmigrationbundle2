Upgrade instructions for upgrading from version 1.x to 2.0
==========================================================

1. Make sure you read carefully all the BC notes in the [release notes](WHATSNEW.md) 

2. Nothing else is required, unless you have one of the following:

    - migrations definitions generated using extension versions 1.x or 2.x, yet to be applied
    - code which extends the migration bundle code/apis

    For both cases, the fix is to apply manual changes to your code/migrations.
